Redis:
  #a secure password that cannot be cracked, please change it!
  #it is also recommended to firewall your redis server with iptables so it can only be accessed by specific IP addresses
  Password: "yHy0d2zdBlRmaSPj3CiBwEv5V3XxBTLTrCsGW7ntBnzhfxPxXJS6Q1aTtR6DSfAtCZr2VxWnsungXHTcF94a4bsWEpGAvjL9XMU"
  #hostname of your redis server, you can use free redis hosting (search for it online) if you do not have the ability to host your own redis server
  #redis server is very lightweight, takes under 30 MB of RAM usually
  Host: "127.0.0.1"
  #must be 2 or higher, if you set to lower, the addon will automatically use 2 as a minimum
  #do not edit MaxConnections if you do not know what you're doing
  #it is only useful to increase this number to account for PING between distant servers and when you are sending a lot of messages constantly
  MaxConnections: 2
  #the default Redis port
  Port: 6379
  #time out in milliseconds, how long it should take before it decides that it is unable to connect when sending a message
  #9000 = 9 seconds
  TimeOut: 9000
  #also known as SSL, only use this if you're running Redis 6.0.6 or higher, older versions will not work correctly
  #it encrypts your traffic and makes data exchange between distant servers secure
  useTLS: false
  #EncryptMessages may be useful if you cannot use TLS due to use of older version of Redis or if you're paranoid about privacy and want to double encrypt your messages
  #however this will not encrypt the initial authentication password, only the messages sent (use TLS for initial authentication password encryption)

  #the encryption configuration must be the same across all servers in order to communicate

  #use 16 characters long key for AES-128 encryption
  #32 characters long key for AES-256 encryption (recommended)
  #AES-128 is faster, but less secure (but it is not crackable by today's technology as of 2020, may be crackable by quantum computers)
  #the AES implementation used in RediSkript uses SIV mode, which makes the same key resistant to cracking for a big count of messages without the need of changing the key very often
  EncryptMessages: true
  #EncryptionKey and MacKey must be different
  EncryptionKey: "32CHARACTERS KEY"
  MacKey: "32CHARACTERS KEY"

RedisBungee:
  # If you want to use RedisBungee, set this to true
  Enabled: false


#the channels from which this server can receive messages
#you can always send messages to all channels!
#you can add as many channels as you wish!

#ideal setup is having one global channel and having one channel that represents server name, so you know who to send messages to
#then a few other utility channels up to your needs
Channels:
  - "global"
  - "servername"
  - "Channel3"
